# Employee-Emergency-Notifications2
This Bot will save time searching for employee IDs In case of emergency according to specific criteria and send mass messages to employees to take safety measures, as well as send the information of employees who have attended in the company to the police.
You may have come across many situations where your organization needs to reach out to
employees urgently.
With Robotic Process Automation (RPA), you can look up your HR system, identi
employees by specific criteria (for example, blood group, work email, and so on), and send mass
messages. Since RPA looks up the HR system as it sends messages, it will have up-to-date
information regarding the employees that need to be notified.
